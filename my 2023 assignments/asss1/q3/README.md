### Question 3
Use Qt’s model/view framework to store and display music album information. The following
information should be stored in your own custom model (that inherits from
QAbstractTableModel):

- composer,
- album name,
- cost (stored as a double, and
- a rating (out of 100, store as an int).

Your sub-classed model should be a well-behaved, editable model (and you will need to add all
the necessary functions to your model). The information should be displayed in a standard
QTableView.

The following functionality should be included:
- There should be a header row.
- The user should be able to add data to the model.
- The replacement value should always display the cents (even as .00).
