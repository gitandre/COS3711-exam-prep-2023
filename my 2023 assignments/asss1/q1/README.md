### Question 1
Write an application that can be used to keep a list of staff member details. 

Each staff member data should include the following:
- A name
- A birth-date, and
- A staff appointment type (one of permanent, part-time, or contract, stored and handled as an
enum).

Include all necessary getter and setter functions. An additional getter can be used to return the
appointment type as a QString.

The application should allow a user to enter details via a GUI. Also, once a staff memberâ€™s details
are entered, they should be saved to a list/container in the application.

The user should be able
to write this list to file (in any acceptable, human-readable format) when needed.

Ensure that you adhere to basic design principles and avoid any anti-patterns in the design of
your solution.
